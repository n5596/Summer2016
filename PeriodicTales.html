Svante Arrhenius: First director of the Nobel Institute. Arrived at an estimate of the amount of gold dissolved in the seawater
and his calculations boiled down to 6 mg per tonne of seawater. At this level, the total reserve of gold in the world's oceans
would be eight billion tonnes. His German friend Fritz Haber, travelled to Stockholm to collect his Nobel Prize for his discovery
of a synthetic route to make ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen. After discussions, Haber resolved to pay the 269 billion goldmarks
which Germany was to pay for World War I, using this scientific idea.

Platinum had a low value and was seen as less valuable when compared to silver. Chabaneau was bought to Madrid to carry out
experiments on the metal. Chabaneau thought he had managed to obtain the pure metal but as it refused to settle down to a standard
pattern (it contained then-undiscovered elements osmium and iridium), and later abandoned the work only returning to it 
when his patron persuaded him to. 
<br>
Louis Catrier changed the rules of high-society jewellery by using platinum as it was hard as opposed to gold and silver
and how the slight lustre of it would focus the attention on the surrounding gemstones. Gold was seen as too flashy and silver had a
property to tarnish.
<br>
Iron has long thought to have male warlike properties. The metallic taste of blood was explained when Vincenzo Menghini roasted the
blood of several mammals and poked the residue with a magnetic knife and found iron particles. Mars is covered with iron which
is speculated to have originated from the meteorites instead of a volcanic eruption. Richard Ford discovered that by 
varying the amount of coal or coke added to the ore, one could produce iron which was brittle or tough.
<br>
Wollaston was a precise and self-controlled man. He could write on glass with a diamond with the script being so small that
a microscope was required to read it. He was also so secretive that he did not announce his discovery of palladium.
<br>
Glenn Seaborg was the greatest elemental discoverer of all time- having produced plutonium,curium,americium,berkelium,
californium and a handful of others.
<br>
Mendeleev's critics were silenced in 1875 when Paul-Emile Lecoq announced that he had discovered a new aluminium-like element
which he had named gallium. Its atomic weight was exactly equal to that which Mendeleev had assigned in his table. Lecoq
reported a density which was lower than that predicted by Mendeleev but Mendeleev told him to obtain a pure sample. When Lecoq
followed these instructions, the density which he arrived at was exactly the one predicted.
<br>
Elemental phosphorous glows in the dark- the light coming from the combustion of short-lived oxides which are created at its
surface when it is exposed to the air. Marine phosphorescence occurs when enzymes trigger chemical reactions in bioluminescent
bacteria but does not involve phosphorous directly.
<br>
The red poppy which we commemorate the loss of life in World War I is a symbol of survival- the flower grew from the soil of
the battlefields which were fertilized with the blood of the slain. However, chlorine- which was used in 1915 would both choke
lungs and bleach the flowers white. Chlorine is the most brutal weapon as it rips through the blood vessels that line the lung and 
the victim eventually drowns in a fluid produced as the body attempts to repair the damage. Haber's wife, Clara, commited suicide
using her husband's revolver whereas his son by his second marriage, Lutz, was haunted by his father's history and wrote
the book The Poisonous Cloud. Haber was forced to leave Germany with his family when his Berlin research insitute was shut down
by the Nazis.

When Pierre-Louis Dulong first made the highly explosive liquid nitrogen trichloride, it cost him and eye and three fingers. When
Ampere warned Davy about the dangers of the experiment- which Davy ignored and proceeded to receive cuts to his eye from flying glass.
<br>
Joseph Priestley: A man of intellectual curiosity who was inspired by  Benjamin Franklin to take up experimental science. He 
later turned his attention to the constant bubbling of the 'fixed air' which emanated from the beer mash next door.
<br>
Lavoisier was sent to the guillotine- hated as a tax collector and ignored for his science.
<br>
Tellurium Poisoning: A criminal, Graham Young, who had killed several people at work as well as his stepmother by tellurium poisoning. The doctors were
unable to figure out the causes of death but Young asked the doctor if they had checked for tellurium poisoning- drawing suspicions 
which were later drawn to be correct. Agatha Christie's book 'The Pale Horse' revoloved around tellurium poisoning and some
readers could identify their symptoms as an effect of tellurium poisoning.
<br>
Argentina is the only country named after a chemical element (silver).
<br>
Henry VIII came to be known as Old Coppernose because he introduced so much copper into the silver coin that the king's nose and 
other raised parts on the coin would turn red as they wore down. The American patriot Paul Revere, achieved fame with his 
copper-bottomed cooking pots and pans. Ductility is copper's most useful property.
<br>
Zinc is the only element which was not discovered by Western Science. A 13th-century Indian text describes how the metal could
be obtained by heating calamine, a zinc oxide, with organic matter.
<br>
Cleopatra- as reported by Pliny- thought of impressing Marcus Antonius by announcing that she would throw the most expensive
banquet ever given. The food was rich enough but not worth what was declared and Antonius' protests were met by Cleopatra removing 
her pearl earrings- the largest ever known- and dissolving them in vinegar. She then drank this liquor and won the wager.
<br>
Several elements are associated with values such as grave lead, honest tin and virtuous silver.
<br>
When steel reflects the sky, it picks up its blues and grays but titanium seems to find the warmth of the sun.
<br>
Humans and other species have generally been very wary of bright colours in nature which may signify ripe fruit and fresh 
meat or warn of poisonous berries and venomous creatures. The colours of fruits are based on yellow xanthophyll, the orange carotenes
and purple anthocyanins which are all organic compounds containing no metallic elements.
<br>
Napolean's death is attributed to arsenic (also known as 'Inheritance Powder'). The green colour of the wallpaper would contain
large quantities of the metal which caused his body to have high levels of arsenic.
<br>
Vanadium in tunicates is can be a hundred times more concentrated than in seawater.
<br>
The red of ruby is due to chromium. The deep red of rubies and limpid green of emeralds are not the reason why they are valued
so much. The chromium in both stones fluoresces with red light so that the stones appear to flicker with inner fire.
<br>
William Ramsay, the professor of chemistry at University College London, discovered five of the inert gases.
<br>
Mercury and sulphur are regarded as the mother and father of all the metals.
<br>
Lecoq (who had discovered gallium) came under severe criticism as several felt the he had pompously named the element after
himself as the Latin for 'coq' was 'gallus'. He had named it after France as Latin for France is 'gallia'.He played it 
safe the next time he discovered an element as he named it samarium.
