<li>They trust me, and they've forgotten how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment.</li>
<li>The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover interesting things.
The problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the fields are new and the seasons
change. All they think about is food and water. Maybe we're all that way, the boy amused.</li>
<li>At a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest
lie.</li>
<li>When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.</li>
<li>If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work toward getting it.</li>
<li>In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own destinies.</li>
<li>
'It's called the principle of favorability. When you play cards for the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner's luck' 
'Why is that?'
'Because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny; it whets your appetite with a taste of success'
</li>
<li> 
	I'm like everyone else- I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what actually does.
</li>
<li> People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want.</li>
<li> God only reveals the future. When he does so, it is for only one reason; it's a future that was written so as to be altered.</li>
<li> It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil. It's what comes out of their mouths that is.</li>
<li> Life attracts life.</li> 
<li> If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment
of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return.</li>
<li> Tell you heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering. And that no heart has suffered when it goes in search of 
its dreams.</li>
<li> What you still need to know is this: before a dream in realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It
does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as 
we've moved toward the dream.</li>
<li> Every search begins with beginner's luck. And every search ends with the victor's being severly tested.</li>
<li> When you possess great treasures withing you, and try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.</li>
<li> The desert was once a sea. The sea has lived on in this shell, because that's its destiny. And it will never cease doing so untile
the desert is once again covered by water.</li>
<li> There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.</li>
<li> Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.</li>
<li> No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.</li>
</ul>
